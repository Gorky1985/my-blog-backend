## Responsive website - TRAVEL BLOG

## Project Overview 🎉

Based on a Video Course made by Shaun Wassell I created a:
Blog where I combined React.js, Node.js and Google Cloud in a full-stack, full-featured website, including user-friendly forms for posting articles and comments. The whole interface was created from React components with Node.js server in the background, connected to MongoDB database, user authentication run by Firebase Auth, and all deployed on Google Cloud Services.
